## Voting System with Group Size Limit

This smart contract implements a voting system with a group size limit. Only eligible voters can participate in the voting process, and each address can only vote once. The contract includes an administrator who can change the maximum group size.

### Features

- Mapping to keep track of whether an address has voted
- Modifier to restrict access to certain functions only to the administrator
- Constructor to set the administrator as the deployer of the contract
- Public function to allow eligible addresses to vote
- Basic input validation using the `require` statement
- Internal function for age verification
- Internal function to check the group size limit
- Internal storage variable to keep track of the total number of votes
- Public function to change the maximum group size, only accessible by the administrator

### Constructor

The constructor is executed when the contract is deployed and sets the administrator as the address that deploys the contract.

### Modifier - `onlyAdministrator()`

This modifier restricts access to a certain function only to the administrator. It verifies that the caller of the function is the administrator. If the condition is not met, the function call will be reverted.

### Public Function - `vote()`

This function allows eligible addresses to vote. It performs basic input validation to ensure the caller's address is valid and they haven't voted already. Additional checks, such as age verification and group size limit, can also be added if needed. If any of the additional checks fail, the function call will be reverted. If all checks pass, the function increments the total number of votes and marks the sender's address as voted.

### Internal Function - `ageVerification()`

This internal function is used to verify the age of the voters. In the example provided, it returns `true` for simplicity, assuming that everyone is eligible to vote.

### Internal Function - `checkGroupSize()`

This internal function checks the group size limit. If the total number of votes exceeds the maximum group size, the function call will be reverted. In the example provided, the maximum group size is assumed to be greater than 0.

### Public Function - `setMaxGroupSize(uint newSize)`

This function allows the administrator to change the maximum group size. It performs input validation to ensure the new size is greater than 0. If the validation check passes, the maximum group size is updated. Only the administrator can call this function, as specified by the `onlyAdministrator()` modifier.
